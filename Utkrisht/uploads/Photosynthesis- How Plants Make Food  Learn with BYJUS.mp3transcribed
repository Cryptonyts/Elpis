Any plant needs three basic things to make food, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. It's the root of the plant that helps extract water from deep under the soil. And also the roots help transport that water, along with some minerals, down to the stem and the leaves and the rest of the parts of the plant. Beautiful. Now, what about carbon dioxide? Well, carbon dioxide is nothing but a gas that is found in the air, right? Now, the leaf of a plant, on its underside, it has little tiny pores that are actually called stomata. Now, these stomata is where the carbon dioxide from the air enters into the plant, right? Beautiful. Now, oh, sunlight. I wonder where sunlight comes from. From the sun, of course. Now, the leaves that we saw, the leaf contains a chemical known as chlorophyll. Now, chlorophyll, the chemical uses water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide to do some magic chemistry and produce food. It actually produces oxygen and sugars, by the way. Now, remember those pores that we spoke of, stomata? That's where the oxygen leaves the plant and gets into the air as well. Now, the sugar that I said that leaves produce is what is stored in different parts of the plant as food. So most plants use this chlorophyll to do photosynthesis. And you see, this process is called photosynthesis because it uses sunlight to produce food.
