Look, I was going to go easy on you. Not to hurt your feelings, but I'm only going to get this one chance. Something's wrong. I can feel it. It's just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen. But I don't know what. If that means what I think it means we're in trouble. Big trouble. And if he is bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances. You would just want to start on. I'm beginning to feel like a rap God.

It's actually disastrously bad for the whack while the masterfully constructed this masterpiece, I'm beginning to feel like a rap God. Rap God all my people from the front to the back nut back nut now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard everybody wants a key and a secret to rapping mortality like I have got will it be true for the blueprints? Simply rage and youthfully two prince everybody loves the room for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid need nothing but shoot for the moon since MC's get taken to school with this music cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme now I lead a new school full of students me, I'm a product of rock him La Kim sebastu pockin waq rin, yella, easy. Thank you. They got slim inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position to meet run DMC, induct him into the motherfucking rockin'roll hall of Fame. Even though I walk in the church in person, a ball of flames only hall of fame I'll be inducted in is the alpha alcohol of fame on the wall of shame, you facts think it's all the game till I walk a flock of flames off a blanket, tell me what in the fuck are you taking? Little gay looking boy, so gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy, you witness in a massacre like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy, boy, they. That boy's gay, that's all they say? Looking boy, you get a thumbs up pad on the back and a way to go from your label every day, looking boy, hey, lookin boy, what you say, looking boy?

Looking boy, I'm a work boy, everything I have never asked nobody for shit get out my face, looking boy basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable be keeping up with the same pace, looking boy cause I'm beginning to feel. I feel like a rap God rap God. All my people from the front to the back knob, back knob. The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR bail and heart of the trailer park the white trash guard kneel before General Tsar this plan is Krypton no Asgard, Asgard so ubi thorn I be Odin be voting I'm omnipotent let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting and I should not be woken I'm the walking dead but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating but I got your mom dethroting, I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common poodle, I'm a Dover and pinch yourself in the yarn and pay homage, pupil, it's me. My honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though for good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in the chicken scratch I scribble into enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case. Cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my pharaoh munch grind so I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you come by up here with the skin color of mine? You get too big and hit it comes tryin to send you like that one line I said, oh, no back from the mathers lp one when I tried to sell take seven kids from Columbine put them all in a line at an AK 47 they're a barber and not see if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm morphin into an immortal coming through the portal? You're stuck in a time war from 2004 though and I don't know what the fuck did you dime for your pointless as rapunzel with fucking corn roasting, right? Normal fuck being normal. And I just bought a new ray gun from the future just to come and shoot y'all like when fabulous made Ray J mad this dad said he looked like a faggot may wear this pads he went to a man while he play pay games, man, oh, man. That was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So AJ went straight to the radio station the very next day. Hey, fab, I'm gonna kill you lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed how to give a motherfucker naughty gets a feeling like it's levitating never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting for the day to think I say I fell off they'll be celebrating cause I know the way they're getting motivated I make elevating music. You make elevator music? Oh, he's too mainstream. Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. It's not hip hop, it's pop. Cause I found a. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you while I'm ripping any one of these verses. The verses? You curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you how many verses I gotta murder to prove that? If you were half as nice as songs you could sacrifice virgins to? Uh, school flunky pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry, I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to when I'm a million leagues above ill when I speak in tongues but it's still tongue and cheek fuck you, Satan. Take the fucking wheel. I'm asleep in the front pumping heavy d in the voice still chunky but funky but in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. And here's what they want from me. They're asking me to eliminate some other women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hate sort of hat, then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination. But fuck it. Life's hand in your limits. Make lemonade then. But if I can't bat other women, how the fuck am I supposed to bake? A mechanism? No mistake is a. It's a fatal mistake. If you think I need to be overseas intended, take a vacation to trip abroad and make a fall on the face. And don't be a retard. Be a king. Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?
