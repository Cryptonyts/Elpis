At first, he was an extraordinarily popular american football player, primarily with the Buffalo Bills. He was also an actor, appeared in several tv shows and commercials. But it all came crashing down in June of 1994, when he was arrested and charged with the murders of his ex wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend Ron Goldman. It took a few days before police decided to charge OJ with those murders. When they finally did, Simpson appeared to be suicidal, and he led authorities on a wild, slow speed chase across LA freeways. There were hours of live coverage on tv of police cars chasing, following Simpson in his white Ford Bronco. And he did end up surrendering at his home in the affluent neighborhood of Brentwood a year later. It was the trial of the century. Simpson managed to get an impressive team of lawyers, nicknamed the Dream Team, and they essentially destroyed the prosecution's arguments, calling this case evidence of systemic racism and sloppy police work. When the verdict finally came in, more than 150 million people watched it live. Of course, OJ Simpson was acquitted, a very divisive verdict that split the country, mostly along racial lines. A decade later, though, OJ Simpson and another author wrote a book called if I did it. That book, as well as a tv interview in which he explains how he would have committed the murders, are essentially seen and widely seen by legal experts as a confession to that crime that was committed back in 1994.
